# HealthyBox <img src='public/img/title-img.png'> DAW Final Project at <a href='http://www.jaumebalmes.net/'>Insitut Jaume Balmes</a>
### As final project we were supposed to do a complete web application with backoffice:
## This is HealthyBox, a healthy food monthly subscription.
<p>We came up with this idea because we wanted to encourage people to eat clean easily subscribing to a 3 different plans that addapted to each of us. We focused in a very clean design, such as the products we're promoting. </p>

<p>As a <strong>user</strong> you can visit our landing page, sign up and log in, view all our products and subscription plans, check all the products ingredients, as well as check all the products you're not allergic/intolerant at and the vegans/vegeterians/organic ones. You can subscribe/unsubscribe and upgrade plans.</p>

<p>As the <strong>admin</strong> you can add/remove products, plans, users and see sales and incomes in graphics.</p>

<p>This awesome app is done by:</p>
